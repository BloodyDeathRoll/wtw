# Backlog

Things we've decided to come back to. Newest first. When one gets picked up, move it to `docs/INTEGRATION.md`; when it ships, delete it here.

| Added | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-03 | **Bigger poster in Blind Taste Test** | The cover on the reveal is too small (150px wide today). Eran wants it much bigger. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Every game poster looks the same** | A game poster is the poster, the "+" ribbon (top-right) and share (bottom-right). Nothing else. Today Blind Taste Test also has a "▶ Trailer" pill: remove it. Until further notice, trailer buttons live only on Recommendations and Watchlist cards. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Homepage share button** | The share in the homepage top bar shares the app itself ("WTW — What To Watch / Find something worth watching"). Eran wants to talk it through. Its icon changes to the forward arrow along with the share feature. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Old games-side "My watchlist" screen** | `src/app/play/components/watchlist.tsx` is still in the code, but nothing opens it anymore: the menu goes to the real watchlist (the feed-style page). Remove it, or confirm it's still needed. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Your match % on a shared title's page** | The friend's page (`/t/…`) could show a signed-in friend their own match, as mocked in `docs/prototypes/share/v3/8b`. Needs the engine to score one title on request (A2). |
| 2026-11-03 | **Share in Six Degrees** | Its film rows are too small for a share button away from the "+"; left out of the share build. |
