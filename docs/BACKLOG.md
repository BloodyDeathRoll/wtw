# Backlog

Things we've decided to come back to. Newest first. When one gets picked up, move it to `docs/INTEGRATION.md`; when it ships, delete it here.

| Added | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-04 | **Search: adding a title teaches your taste** | Eran decided it should. The MVP only saves the card. Needs the DNA writer (A3) to take a "saved from search" signal. |
| 2026-11-04 | **Search: match % and "Why it's a match"** | The MVP card has no score. Same missing piece as the shared page's match: the engine scoring one title on request (A2), plus an AI call for the reason (a 1–3s wait, free-tier limits). |
| 2026-11-04 | **Search: "Seen it? Tell me how it was" on the card** | Left out of the MVP; small once the taste signal above exists. |
| 2026-11-04 | **Search: suggestions from the first letters, and forgiving typos** | TMDB only matches whole words ("se" → junk). Our 35k could do it, but `title ilike 'se%'` took 7.3s: needs a trigram index on `titles.title` (one migration), which also gives typo tolerance. |
| 2026-11-04 | **Where to watch in Israel, not the US** | Search, the feed and the shared page all read the US listing (`WATCH_REGION`), so Shtisel says Chai Flicks, not Netflix, and titles outside our catalogue show nothing. Changing it touches all three. |
| 2026-11-04 | **Search for people** | The new Search (menu, under Play) is titles-only in v1. Later: type a director, writer or actor ("Nolan") and get their titles. TMDB has a person search; `searchPerson` in `src/lib/tmdb.ts` already resolves a name to one person. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Bigger poster in Blind Taste Test** | The cover on the reveal is too small (150px wide today). Eran wants it much bigger. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Every game poster looks the same** | A game poster is the poster, the "+" ribbon (top-right) and share (bottom-right). Nothing else. Today Blind Taste Test also has a "▶ Trailer" pill: remove it. Until further notice, trailer buttons live only on Recommendations and Watchlist cards. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Homepage share button** | The share in the homepage top bar shares the app itself ("WTW — What To Watch / Find something worth watching"). Eran wants to talk it through. Its icon changes to the forward arrow along with the share feature. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Old games-side "My watchlist" screen** | `src/app/play/components/watchlist.tsx` is still in the code, but nothing opens it anymore: the menu goes to the real watchlist (the feed-style page). Remove it, or confirm it's still needed. |
| 2026-11-03 | **Your match % on a shared title's page** | The friend's page (`/t/…`) could show a signed-in friend their own match, as mocked in `docs/prototypes/share/v3/8b`. Needs the engine to score one title on request (A2). |
| 2026-11-03 | **Share in Six Degrees** | Its film rows are too small for a share button away from the "+"; left out of the share build. |
